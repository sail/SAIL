* What is SAIL

Biomedical studies are growing rapidly in both size and complexity.
In the search for genetic or environmental factors that affect our health,
very large numbers of patient samples and data generated from assays on these
are being collected and stored in biobanks and other repositories holding data or biomaterial.
Collection sizes are approaching millions of samples from a variety of cohorts and studies,
with thousands of phenotypes or other types of sample data collected in a variety of experimental conditions.
Technical solutions are needed to browse, index, annotate and manage such complex content.
We have developed a system addressing this need, SAIL (“Sample Availability System”).
The system is designed to hold phenotype availability information and meta data about samples,
experiments and phenotypes, submitted by data owners or databases that contain actual measurement data. 
By being geared towards a complexity level that focus on describing data and availability
rather than the measurements themselves, SAIL provides a way to browse and summarise complex
content across diverse resources. This can be used in many different scenarios from designing new studies,
understanding previous studies, and finding data and biomaterial from different cohorts that can be combined
in meta-analysis studies. SAIL also contains functionality to annotate collections,
with tools to create new vocabularies or use terms from standard sample ontologies,
and to combine and harmonise vocabularies. The system can handle real valued data as well as availability data,
which is useful to match study samples from different cohorts and to find the availability of samples
in certain ranges of study parameters or measurements. The SAIL system is an easy and flexible tool
for researchers and co-ordinators of sample collections to browse, understand and update large and complex
 content across many diverse resources to maximize their scientific value and usability.
